# Hi there! ðŸŒ³
`sep` is a little package to help you wrangle with and visualize the data from the Swiss Environmental Panel more easily. 

## What is the Swiss Environmental Panel? 

The Swiss Environmental Panel is based on a random sample of the Swiss population over 15 years of age from the harmonised population register of the Federal Statistical Office (FSO/SRPH). Included are also foreign nationals residing in Switzerland. Respondents are invited to participate by letter in the main language of their municipality. The survey can be answered on paper or electronically in German, French or Italian. In order to be able to record developments over time, some questions are taken over from similar surveys in 1994 and 2007 ("Swiss Environmental Survey" by Andreas Diekmann and co-workers). The project is designed as a panel with short and long surveys, i.e. the same people will be surveyed several times over the next few years. Two surveys are conducted per year. You can find more information [here](https://istp.ethz.ch/umweltpanel.html).

## How does `sep` help me?

sep' helps the project collaborators to automate the data collection and visualisations for the survey reports. The various functions of the package are designed to facilitate this process from start to finish. For common practices in exploratory data analysis, the `eda_*` functions contain the most common operations. The `plot_*` functions, on the other hand, simplify visualisations. Finally, `cb_*` functions are planned to automate the creation of our codebooks partially.
